All required image processing functions, including exposure control, gamma, white balance, color saturation, hue control, defective pixel canceling, noise canceling, etc., are programmable through the SCCB interface or embedded microcontroller. The OV5640 also includes a compression engine for increased processing power. In addition, OmniVision image sensors use proprietary sensor technology to improve image quality by reducing or eliminating common lighting/electrical sources of image contamination, such as fixed pattern noise, smearing, etc., to produce a clean, fully stable, color image. The OV5640 has an embedded microcontroller, which can be combined with an internal autofocus engine and programmable general purpose I/O modules (GPIO) for external autofocus control. It also provides an anti-shake function with an internal anti-shake engine. For identification and storage purposes, the OV5640 also includes a one-time programmable (OTP) memory."

If 1.8V is used for I/O power, using the internal DVDD is preferred. If 2.8V is used for I/O power, due to a high voltage drop at the internal DVDD regulator, there is a potential heat issue. Hence, for a 2.8V power system, OmniVision recommends using an external DVDD source. Due to the higher power down current when using an external DVDD source, OmniVision strongly recommends cutting off all powers, including the external DVDD, when the sensor is not in use in the case of 2.8V I/O and external DVDD."

The UV adjust parameters, UV adj th1, UV adj th2, and offset low, offset high should be entered into the registers to set the curve. To get these values, first set the values of UV adj th1, UV adj th2, offset low and offset high. Then, calculate the values of a and k as follows: k = (offset high - offset low) / (UV adj th2 - UV adj th1) a = offset high + (offset high - offset low)/(UV adj th2 - UV adj th1) 5-13 OV5640 color CMOS QSXGA (5 megapixel) image sensor with OmniBSI™ technology Registers to be changed: - UV adj th1[8:0] = registers 0x5589[7:0] - UV adj th2[8:0] = registers {0x558A[0], 0x558B[7:0]} - offset high = register 0x5583[7:0] (when 0x5580[1]=1 and 0x5588[6]=0) - offset low = register 0x5584[7:0] (when 0x5580[1]=1 and 0x5588[6]=0) figure 5-1 UV adjust graph"
