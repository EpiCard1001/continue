As the sensor can measure DC accelerations, this can be done easily by pointing the axis of interest towards the center of the Earth, noting the output value, rotating the sensor by 180 degrees (pointing to the sky) and noting the output value again. By doing so, a ±1 g acceleration is applied to the sensor. Subtracting the larger output value from the smaller one, and dividing the result by 2, leads to the actual sensitivity of the sensor. This value changes very little over temperature and also over time. The sensitivity tolerance describes the range of sensitivity of a large population of sensors."

A sensor in a steady-state on a horizontal surface measures 0 g on the X-axis and 0 g on the Y-axis, whereas the Z-axis measures 1 g. The output is ideally in the center of the dynamic range of the sensor (the content of the OUT registers is 00h, data expressed as 2's complement number). A deviation from the ideal value in this case is called zero-g offset. Offset is, to some extent, a result of stress to the MEMS sensor and therefore the offset can slightly change after mounting the sensor onto a printed circuit board or exposing it to extensive mechanical stress. Offset changes little over temperature, see \"Zero-g level change vs. temperature\" in *Table 3*. The zero-g level tolerance (TyOff) describes the standard deviation of the range of zero-g levels of a population of sensors."

The self-test function is off when the self-test bit (ST) of CTRL_REG4 (control register 4) is programmed to '0'. When the self-test bit of CTRL_REG4 is programmed to '1' an actuation force is applied to the sensor, simulating a definite input acceleration. In this case, the sensor outputs exhibit a change in their DC levels which are related to the selected full scale through the device sensitivity. When self-test is activated, the device output level is given by the algebraic sum of the signals produced by the acceleration acting on the sensor and by the electrostatic testforce. If the output signals change within the amplitude specified in *Table 3*, then the sensor is working properly and the parameters of the interface chip are within the defined specifications."

In this way the device, even if sleeping, continues to sense acceleration and to generate interrupt requests.

To be compatible with traditional packaging techniques, a cap is placed on top of the sensing element to prevent blocking of moving parts during the molding phase of the plastic encapsulation.

Both the read register and write register commands are completed in 16 clock pulses or in multiples of 8 in cases of multiple read/write bytes. Bit duration is the time between two falling edges of SPC. The first bit (bit 0) starts at the first falling edge of SPC, after the falling edge of CS, while the last bit (bit 15, bit 23, ...) starts at the last falling edge of SPC, just before the rising edge of CS. bit 0: RW bit. When 0, the data DI(7:0) is written into the device. When 1, the data DO(7:0) from the device is read. In the latter case, the chip drives SDO at the start of bit 8. bit 1: MS bit. When 0, the address remains unchanged in multiple read/write commands."

In order to obtain this clearance it is recommended to open the PCB thermal pad solder mask The area below the sensor (on the same side of the board) must be defined as keepout area. It is strongly recommended not to place any structure in the top metal layer underneath the sensor Traces connected to pads should be as symmetrical as possible. Symmetry and balance for pad connection helps component self alignment and leads to a better control of solder paste reduction after reflow For better performances over temperature it is strongly recommended not to place large insertion components like buttons or shielding boxes at distances less than 2 mm from the sensor Central die pad and \"Pin 1 Indicator\" are physically connected to GND. Leave \"Pin 1 Indicator\" unconnected during soldering."

The stencil and printed circuit assembly should be aligned to within 25 μm (1 mil) prior to application of the solder paste."

It is not functional to define a specific soldering profile for the accelerometer only. The user should use a time and temperature reflow profile that is derived from the PCB design and manufacturing experience."
